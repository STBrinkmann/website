The GVI R package helps researchers compute the Greenness Visibility Index (GVI) presented by [Labib, Huck and Lindley (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143050). The GVI is calculated using a Digital Surface Model (DSM), Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Greenness Raster. GVI is written in C++ to provide fast and light weighted functionality.

title: "Räumliche Erreichbarkeit von Gedächtnisambulanzen – Eine geographische Analyse im Rahmen von digiDEM Bayern"
summary: "Memory clinics play a crucial role in the qualified diagnosis of dementia. This study aimed to assess the accessibility of memory clinics for people with dementia in Bavaria by utilizing a Geographic Information System (GIS) to calculate travel times from all Bavarian municipalities to the nearest memory clinic using OpenStreetMap data. It was found that the majority (40%; n = 93,950) of modeled individuals with dementia live in communities with an average travel time of 20 to 40 minutes to the nearest clinic, while approximately 7,000 (3%) face a travel time of more than one hour, particularly in rural areas. In light of demographic trends, improving accessibility to memory clinics across all locations is imperative. The expansion of memory clinics in areas with lengthy travel times or the introduction of mobile diagnostic services could enhance care for people with dementia."

# Abstract
*Background* Memory clinics can contribute significantly to a qualified diagnosis of dementia. Since the accessibility of medical facilities is an important predictor for their utilisation, the aim of this study was to determine the accessibility of memory clinics for persons with dementia in Bavaria.

*Methods* We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine travel times to the nearest memory clinic for all Bavarian municipalities based on OpenStreetMap road network data.

*Results* The majority of the modelled persons with dementia in Bavaria (40%; n = 93,950) live in communities with an average travel time of 20 to 40 minutes to the nearest memory clinic. Almost 7,000 (3%) require more than one hour. Especially persons from rural communities have to travel significantly longer distances than people from urban areas.

*Conclusion* In view of demographic developments, there is an urgent need for memory clinics to be accessible throughout the country for all persons with dementia, regardless of where they live. The systematic development of memory clinics in areas with long travel times or the establishment of mobile diagnostic services could help to improve dementia care.
